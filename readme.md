# Description
This project is an messy, unstructured exploration of how to visualize math concepts

# Goals and Principles
The project is going to require many little decisions which will add up to the (currently) unknowable outcome. Both top down, goal-oriented thinking and bottom-up, principle-oriented thinking must drive these decisions. Both are wishy-washy and meaningless without an explicit decision of what laudable goals/principles are being de-prioritized to allow sufficient focus. Here are my goals for the project, in priority order:
## Goals
1. Trying to draw Python analogies to math concepts
    1. __Not__ to be comprehensive or even perfectly accurate
1. Move quickly, build that deeper understanding, then get back to learning new concepts
    1. __Not__ to build something for presentation. Not strictly following PEP8

## Principles
1. Start with indivdual examples, then generalize
